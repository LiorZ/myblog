title: Why people ignore grave dangers even when the evidence is right in front of them

Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetlzer were two Slovak jews that back in 1944 managed to escape from Auschwitz and were the first jews to do so. The story of their escape is an incredible story of survival and is told in great detail in an excellent book by Jonathan Freedland's - ["The Escape Artist"](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60194141). 
In short, Wetzler and Vrba managed to reach Slovakia, where, thanks to Vrba's phenomenal memory they wrote a detailed report about their experiences in the camp, including information about the mass murder of Jews, the use of gas chambers, and the operation of the camp. They were eager to let the world know about the camp because they noticed that the Nazis are working hard to expand it so that they could annhilate quickly the entire jewish population of Hungary before the war is over. The jews of Hungary in April 1944 was the last Jewish community in Europe - over 800,000 jews that hasn't yet been deported to the east.
